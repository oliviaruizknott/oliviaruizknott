I’m Livvy. I love making things. Specifically: delightful, beloved, and somewhat frivolous things. Currently, I work as a software engineer. If you know how I can make delightful things for money, I want to know about it. I’m especially interested in working at a cool studio, designing and building games, visualizing data, or museum exhibitry. 

Software-engineering-wise, I’ve worked with these tools so far: Python, Django, Javascript, ReactJS, Gatsby, Contentful, Netlify, Ruby, Rails, SQL, KnockoutJS, HTML, CSS, Tailwind, a variety of testing frameworks.
